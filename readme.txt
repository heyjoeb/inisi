Hey Jonathan!

Welcome to our slack!

We've got a project which you might be able to help us with, it is for a customer of us "GOOSE VPN".
We're building the HTML templates for their new custom dashboard. We've already made a couple of pages, but there are still quite some left to do.

I see that you've already been invited to our Invision group, here you can find the designs for the templates. For pages such as the "Update Page" there are some things you can copy from the already existing templates if needed.

Only the screens under the "Portal" section have to be made, all the others are being done by the customer itself for now.

============================

Steps to setup the compilers:

- Open terminal
- cd /development
- npm install
- npm install bower
- bower install
(- Select 1st jQuery option when being asked)
- npm install composer
- composer install (Select option "Y")

Then run "gulp watch" and you're ready to go.

Let me know if you have any further questions.
